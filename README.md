### Project Description
PhoneIsBad is a real-time focus assistant that uses webcam-based eye-gaze tracking to detect when a user looks down at their phone. When prolonged distraction is detected, the system triggers visual and audio alerts to help the user regain focus.

### The Problem Statement
Excessive and unconscious phone usage disrupts productivity and focus during study or work sessions. Existing solutions rely on manual timers or app blockers, which fail to detect distraction in real time.

### The Solution
We built a browser-based gaze tracking system using MediaPipe Face Landmarker that monitors eye position via webcam. If the user looks down for a defined duration, the system triggers alerts, encouraging healthier digital habits.
